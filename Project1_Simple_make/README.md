# CSCI 4061: Simple Make

The Simple Make is an utility program what will build executable libraries or program such as .o files or libraries based on the Makefile in the directory. The simple Makefile will administrate the similar functionality of the GNU make, such as generating the executable files or clean all the executable libraries etc. Once the simple makefile is generated, it can be used in any program files that can replace the functionality of GNU make.
