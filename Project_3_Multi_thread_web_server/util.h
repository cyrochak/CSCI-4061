/**********************************************
 * init
   - port is the number of the port you want the server to be
     started on
   - initializes the connection acception/handling system
   - YOU MUST CALL THIS EXACTLY ONCE (not once per thread,
     but exactly one time, in the main thread of your program)
     BEFORE USING ANY OF THE FUNCTIONS BELOW
   - if init encounters any errors, it will call exit().
************************************************/
void init(int port);

/**********************************************
 * accept_connection - takes no parameters
   - returns a file descriptor for further request processing.
     DO NOT use the file descriptor on your own -- use
     get_request() instead.
   - if the return value is negative, the request should be ignored.
***********************************************/
int accept_connection(void);

/**********************************************
 * get_request
   - parameters:
      - fd is the file descriptor obtained by accept_connection()
        from where you wish to get a request
      - filename is the location of a character buffer in which
        this function should store the requested filename. (Buffer
        should be of size 1024 bytes.)
   - returns 0 on success, nonzero on failure. You must account
     for failures because some connections might send faulty
     requests. This is a recoverable error - you must not exit
     inside the thread that called get_request. After an error, you
     must NOT use a return_request or return_error function for that
     specific 'connection'.
************************************************/
int get_request(int fd, char *filename);

/**********************************************
 * return_result
   - returns the contents of a file to the requesting client and cleans
     up the connection to the client
   - parameters:
      - fd is the file descriptor obtained by accept_connection()
        to where you wish to return the result of a request
      - content_type is a pointer to a string that indicates the
        type of content being returned. possible types include
        "text/html", "text/plain", "image/gif", "image/jpeg" cor-
        responding to .html, .txt, .gif, .jpg files.
      - buf is a pointer to a memory location where the requested
        file has been read into memory (the heap). return_result
        will use this memory location to return the result to the
        user. (remember to use -D_REENTRANT for CFLAGS.) you may
        safely deallocate the memory after the call to
        return_result (if it will not be cached).
      - numbytes is the number of bytes the file takes up in buf
   - returns 0 on success, nonzero on failure.
************************************************/

/**********************************************
 * return_error
   - returns an error message in response to a bad request and cleans
     up the connection to the client
   - parameters:
      - fd is the file descriptor obtained by accept_connection()
        to where you wish to return the error
      - buf is a pointer to the location of the error text
   - returns 0 on success, nonzero on failure.
